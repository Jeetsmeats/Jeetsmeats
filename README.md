# Hi, i am Jeet 😃👋

I code.

## Little bit about me
I am a geek.  

if you like:
- electronics
- spiderman  
- programming
- linus

we will probably like each other :)

## The kind of engineer I am

I like to:
1. Prototype hard.
2. Test hard.
3. Deploy a hard-core mvp.
4. Write some hard...looking documentation.

I’m not the Usain Bolt of software development, that's why I use AI to help me ship faster.

What I am is an engineer who enjoys planning, designing, and scaling products.

I value practical learning and applying new techniques, skills, and ideas that can have a measurable and positive impact for a product’s users.

## 🏋️ outside of code

- working with my hands
- dancing
- karaoke
- pickleball
- tennis
