# Hi, i am Jeet 😃👋

I code.

## Stuff I have done


## The kind of engineer I am

I like to:
1. Prototype hard.
2. Test hard.
3. Deploy a hard-core mvp for clients.
4. Write some hard...looking documentation.

I’m not the Usain Bolt of software development, I use AI to help me ship faster.

What I am is an engineer who enjoys planning, designing, and scaling products. I’m still new to the industry and I have plenty to learn, which I consider one of my strongest attributes.

I value practical learning and applying new techniques, skills, and ideas that can have a measurable and positive impact for a product’s users.
