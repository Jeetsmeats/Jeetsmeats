# hey, i'm jeet👋  

i build things.

sometimes they work.  
sometimes they teach me humility.  
both outcomes are acceptable.

i’m an engineer who enjoys:
- making hardware talk to software  
- making software behave  
- and occasionally making distributed systems regret existing

## 🧠 what i actually do

i’ve:
- tracked rockets with software defined radios (yes, actual rockets)  
- made raspberry pis do synchronized things like they’re in a boy band  
- trained reinforcement learning agents that sometimes drive better than i do  
- built data pipelines that politely move sensor data around  
- designed control systems that try very hard not to explode  

i like problems that look slightly unreasonable at first glance.

## ⚙️ my engineering vibe

- calm > chaotic  
- reliable > clever  
- depth > noise  
- mastery > hype  
- “let’s understand this properly” > “ship it and pray”  

i’m not trying to be the 10x engineer.

i’m trying to be the engineer you trust at 2am when production is on fire.

## 🌱 currently evolving into

- someone with better system intuition  
- someone who understands product, not just code  
- someone who doesn’t overthink pull request comments  
- a more dangerous embedded engineer  

---

## 🏋️ outside of code

- tutoring maths & physics  
- lifting heavy things  
- thinking about long-term financial freedom  
- trying to become 1% better without becoming 100% insufferable

if you like:
- embedded systems  
- distributed systems  
- sustainable tech  
- calm ambition  
- or slightly over-engineered side projects  

we’ll probably get along.
